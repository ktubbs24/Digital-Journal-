  collapsed:: true
	- How I came across this thought:
		- I had the thought come across my mind and I think that it was a warning from God about Lamar
	- My comments:
		- What I think I should do if this is true:
		  collapsed:: true
			- If this is true and a warning from God that Lamar's conscience has been seared then I would need to handle myself around him with extra caution because that would mean that he is not affected by sinning or doing wrong according to God's definition of right and wrong which is what I have been seeing with him overtime since I have been associating with him #seared_conscience
		- When I am disobedient to God I am endorsing and making Lamar's conscience become more seared:
		  collapsed:: true
			- When I do not take us being intimate outside of marriage and fornication serious when I know better than I basically am endorsing his heart to be seared even more because he does not know what he is doing
				- This is a huge problem because I am supposed to be leading him to Jesus Christ and not making it to where the truth of the gospel does not penetrate or prick his heart because it would be growing colder and more seared through my disobedience instead of becoming softer and receiving the gospel truth of Jesus saving us from our sins
		- If I was someone that was living in lust and did not know any better and was intimate with someone I would also want to know the truth as well
		- I do not think that this is something that is permanent but I do need to be wary
