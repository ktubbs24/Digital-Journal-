	- What does my core work section mean: 
	  collapsed:: true
		- What does my core work section mean:
		- Work done unto the LORD
		- Work done for His Bride and Church
		- Work seen in skills and talents I have been blessed with that I do effortlessly
		- Things that I do not have to practice even if I put that skill or talent down for awhile I do not forget how to do it
		- This is because this is something that God has called me to do and not just something that I have to teach myself on how to do which is different because anything that I am called to do will be something that I do not have to learn and work to understand on how to do because it would be apart of how I am made and who I am.
