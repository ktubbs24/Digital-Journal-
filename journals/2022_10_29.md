- [[Lamar Majors]] I realized how dangerous I have been playing with God and with sin after Lamar was over my apartment last night and spent the night a second time
	- Me and Lamar were intimate this morning after he slept over last night and it was without penetration but I was still convicted that what we did was still a sin because:
		- I was practicing oral sex on Lamar and orally pleasing him #[[Oral Sex]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- I enjoyed it and I enjoyed seeing that he enjoyed it *(but the sexual act was still out of marriage so this act was a sin)*
			- The fact that I enjoyed orally pleasing Lamar and seeing him pleased orally outside of marriage is a representation of the fruit of me serving the flesh *which is a huge problem for me*
		- The intention of our hearts was based on pleasuring mine and his flesh #[[Obeying the Lusts of the Flesh]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- and not on being lovers of God because we were practicing being lovers of pleasure and calling pleasure and the practice of what we were doing love when we were practicing lust and
			- which meant that our hearts were focused on pleasing and obeying our flesh's desires instead of God's desire for us to not have sex of any kind before marriage but desiring to please Him first and not the flesh
			- and this is why when sex is done out of marriage then it is not love but it is lust and this is because
				- God is love and anything that is done out of love is not done in God and anything done out of God is lust
